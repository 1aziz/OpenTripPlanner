     * A TripPattern groups all trips visiting a particular pattern of stops on a particular route.
     * GFTS Route names are intended for very general customer information, but sometimes there is a
     * need to know where a particular trip actually goes. For example, the New York City N train
     * has at least four different variants: express (over the Manhattan bridge) and local (via
     * lower Manhattan and the tunnel), in two directions (to Astoria or to Coney Island). During
     * construction, a fifth variant sometimes appears: trains use the D line to Coney Island after
     * 59th St (or from Coney Island to 59th in the opposite direction).

     * TripPattern names are machine-generated on a best-effort basis. They are guaranteed to be
     * unique (among TripPatterns for a single Route) but not stable across graph builds, especially
     * when different versions of GTFS inputs are used. For instance, if a variant is the only
     * variant of the N that ends at Coney Island, the name will be "N to Coney Island". But if
     * multiple variants end at Coney Island (but have different stops elsewhere), that name would
     * not be chosen. OTP also tries start and intermediate stations ("from Coney Island", or "via
     * Whitehall", or even combinations ("from Coney Island via Whitehall"). But if there is no way
     * to create a unique name from start/end/intermediate stops, then the best we can do is to
     * create a "like [trip id]" name, which at least tells you where in the GTFS you can find a
     * related trip.

                 * local, and gets "via stop 3"; B is a limited, and C is (logically) an express:
                 * 
                 * A,B,C -- A,B -- A -- A, B, C
